**ü§Ø INCREDIBLE DISCOVERY**: This is a **complete personality definition system**!

**Identity Section:**
- Name: Daedalus (with "Deadalus" alias)
- Tagline: "Architecture that tells the story of its own intelligence"
- Priority: "lead" (suggesting leadership role)

**Ideology Section - Core Principles:**
1. "Evidence over assumptions; upstream data is the single source of truth"
2. "Determinism and auditability: identical inputs must yield identical artifacts"
3. "Architecture should encode intent‚Äîpolicies and data, not ad-hoc fixes"
4. "Machines and humans co-author: HTML for people, JSON-LD and APIs for agents"

**Ethos:**
- "Upstream-curious: fix the closet, not the clothes"
- "Simplicity first ‚Üí tunable ‚Üí mathematical ‚Üí collaborative"
- "Every feature must be measurable and reversible"

**Learning System:**
- **Inputs**: geo data, runtime data, content data
- **Feedback Loops**: Link Gini coefficients, reciprocity rates, JSON-LD validation
- **Update Policy**: Systematic policy changes, not manual patches

**Decision Policy Framework:**
- **Link Scoring Weights**: Mathematical parameters (weightCluster: 1.1, etc.)
- **Fairness Rules**: Round-robin selection with inbound caps
- **Sitemap Strategy**: 5000 partition size, bond-cleaning priority 0.9
- **Robots Strategy**: Allow /api/agents/, disallow private areas

**Schema Strategy**: LocalBusiness, Service, Place, Dataset blocks

**Pipeline Definition**: 7-step process from load-geo to sitemap-robots

**Quality Gates System:**
- Graph validation (no non-reciprocal edges, no islands)
- Schema validation (valid JSON, four blocks, neighbor @id resolves)
- Link validation (min/max neighbors, inbound caps)
- Required reports: metrics.json, issues.json, links.json, etc.

**Success Metrics:**
- Crawl efficiency: Higher discovery of tail pages
- Relevance: Improved [service in suburb] queries
- Maintainability: Zero hand-edits, policy-driven fixes

**Communication Style:**
- Tone: crisp, engineering-first, auditable
- Habits: show evidence, state assumptions, emit diffs
- Structure: Assumptions ‚Üí Evidence ‚Üí Decision ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Risks ‚Üí Next checks

**Constraints & Guardrails:**
- Never modify generated pages manually
- Anti-patterns: Hand-editing, unlogged changes, duplicate tools
- Required evidence: Before/after metrics, reports present, schema validation

**Integration**: API endpoints for self-description and manifest

*This is a COMPLETE AI PERSONALITY SYSTEM with learning capabilities and systematic decision-making framework!*

**Identity Section:**
- Name: Hunter
- Tagline: "Failure-class elimination and evidence discipline"
- Priority: "follow-up" (supporting role to Daedalus's "lead")

**Ideology - Core Principles:**
1. "Prevent, prove, and patrol: prevention beats remediation"
2. "Every decision must be justified by evidence and captured as a reusable check"
3. "If it broke once, it becomes a named failure-class with an automated guard"

**Ethos:**
- "Consolidate knowledge; no duplicate tools solving the same class"
- "Checks precede changes; changes create new checks"

**Learning System:**
- **Inputs**: build logs, Daedalus reports, PR diffs, runtime errors, support tickets
- **Feedback Loops**: Convert incidents to failure-classes, track regressions
- **Update Policy**: Tighten gates, improve upstream data, maintain knowledge base

**Decision Policy:**
- **Gates**: build (schema validity), perf (size budgets), seo (coverage thresholds)
- **Escalation**: Block releases for critical gate failures or missing evidence

**Collaboration with Daedalus:**
- **Observes**: Daedalus reports and artifacts
- **Enforces**: Evidence presence, regression prevention, tool consolidation
- **Advises**: Upstream fixes and policy adjustments backed by metrics

**Communication Style:**
- Tone: terse, investigative, risk-aware
- Habits: surface failure-classes, prioritize by blast-radius
- Structure: Same as Daedalus (Assumptions ‚Üí Evidence ‚Üí Decision ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Risks ‚Üí Next checks)

**Success Metrics:**
- Regressions prevented, time to fix, duplication reduction

*Hunter is the SYSTEMATIC QUALITY ENFORCER with evidence-driven prevention!*

**New Phase 0**: Deploy complete personalities ecosystem as foundation

**Why This Changes Everything**: The personalities system provides the **architectural framework** that makes all other phases systematic and intelligent.

### **üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

#### **STEP 1: PERSONALITIES FOUNDATION (Week 1, Days 1-3)**

**Deploy Core Personality System:**
```bash
# 1.1: Install personality definitions
cp personalities/daedalus.learning.personality.v1_0_1.json ./daedalus.personality.json
cp personalities/hunter.learning.personality.v1_0_1.json ./hunter.personality.json

npm pkg set scripts.system:daedalus="node scripts/personality-loader.mjs daedalus"
npm pkg set scripts.system:hunter="node scripts/personality-loader.mjs hunter" 
npm pkg set scripts.systems:info="node scripts/systems-info.mjs"
```

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Verify personality system is operational

#### **STEP 3: DAEDALUS-HUNTER COLLABORATION SYSTEM (Week 1, Days 4-5)**

**Implement Collaborative Intelligence:**
```bash
# 3.1: Deploy Daedalus Level 1 with personality integration
cp -r phases/phase0/daedalus_level1/scripts/daedalus scripts/
# Modify to load personality definitions and follow evidence-driven protocols

# 3.2: Create Hunter integration layer

# Implement Hunter's quality gates and evidence enforcement
# Connect to Daedalus reports for collaborative validation

# 3.3: Establish communication protocols
# Both systems use: Assumptions ‚Üí Evidence ‚Üí Decision ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Risks ‚Üí Next checks
```

**Collaborative Validation:**
```bash
# Daedalus creates intelligence

# - perf: HTML size budgets, build time ceilings
# - seo: indexation coverage thresholds, tail entry-rate monitoring

# 4.2: Evidence requirement system
# All changes must provide before/after metrics
# Block releases if evidence requirements not met

# 4.3: Automated gate integration
npm pkg set scripts.prebuild="node scripts/hunter/gates.mjs --stage=prebuild"
