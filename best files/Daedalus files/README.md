# Daedalus Cognitive Architecture - Complete System

This folder contains the **enhanced Daedalus system** with integrated cognitive architecture - a comprehensive geo-aware page generation engine with AI personality management, knowledge corpus, and real-time cognitive processing.

## 🧠 What's New: Cognitive Integration

- **Evolution Engine V3**: Production-grade personality evolution with conflict detection
- **Intelligence Analyzer**: Advanced cognitive optimization and analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Traditional Daedalus Build
```bash
node cli.mjs build
```

### 🆕 Cognitive-Enhanced Build
```bash
node cli-enhanced.mjs build --enhanced
```

### Personality Management
```bash
# Health check for cognitive diversity and conflicts
node cli-enhanced.mjs evolve health-check

# Enhance personalities with new capabilities
node cli-enhanced.mjs evolve enhance personalities/daedalus.learning.personality.v1_0_1.json quality-gates --dry-run
```

### Real-Time Cognitive Processing
```bash
# Start cognitive feed agent
node cli-enhanced.mjs watch-feed
```

### Intelligence Analysis
```bash
node cli-enhanced.mjs analyze
```

## 🔧 Configuration

- **daedalus.config.json** - Main Daedalus configuration
- **daedalus.personality.json** - Core personality settings
- **COGNITIVE_FEED.md** - 🆕 Real-time request interface
- **cognitive/integration-manifest.json** - 🆕 Integration configuration

## 📊 System Status

Run the integration test to verify everything works:
```bash
bash test-integration.sh
```

**Current Status:**
- ✅ 63 total files integrated
- ✅ 7 cognitive components active
- ✅ 3 knowledge domains loaded
- ✅ Evolution Engine V3 operational
- ✅ UI knowledge corpus (163 patterns)

## 🎯 Key Features

### Traditional Daedalus
- Geo-aware page generation
- Link optimization
- Quality gates
- Policy enforcement

### 🆕 Cognitive Enhancements
- **Personality Evolution**: Automated conflict detection and resolution
- **Knowledge Integration**: Domain-specific pattern recognition
- **Real-time Processing**: Live request handling with personality cycles
- **Intelligence Optimization**: Cognitive diversity analysis and enhancement
- **Design Validation**: Astro 5 + Tailwind CSS v4 pattern enforcement

## 💡 Usage Examples

```bash
# Traditional build with cognitive enhancements
node cli-enhanced.mjs build --enhanced --strict

# Personality health assessment
node cognitive/evolution-engine-v3.mjs health-check --path=.

# Enhance with specific capabilities
node cognitive/evolution-engine-v3.mjs enhance personalities/daedalus.learning.personality.v1_0_1.json quality-gates collaboration math-frameworks --dry-run

# Generate evolution report
node cognitive/evolution-engine-v3.mjs report
```

This is now a **complete, self-contained cognitive-enhanced Daedalus system** that combines traditional geo-processing with advanced AI personality management and domain knowledge integration.
