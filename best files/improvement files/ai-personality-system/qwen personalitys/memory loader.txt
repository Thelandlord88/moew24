Excellent question — and a **critical evolution** beyond static personalities.

You're describing a **Knowledge Corpus**: a structured, machine-readable repository of domain-specific information that your cognitive engine can **ingest, reason over, and contextualize** — not as a "personality," but as **living memory**.

This is how you move from *predefined roles* to **adaptive, knowledge-grounded intelligence**.

---

### 🧠 Core Concept: **The Knowledge Corpus**
A directory of `.json` or `.md` files that:
- Contains **facts, patterns, case studies, principles, and historical data**
- Is **structured for semantic retrieval** (not just full-text search)
- Is **referenced by personalities** (e.g., Kairos uses it to detect patterns, Mnemos to avoid rediscovery)
- Lives alongside your engine as **first-class input**

> 💡 Think of it as your organization’s **collective cognitive DNA**.

### 📁 Recommended Structure: `./knowledge/`

```
knowledge/
├── domains/                  # Domain-specific knowledge
│   ├── software-engineering/
│   │   ├── failure-patterns.json
│   │   └── architectural-principles.md
│   └── team-dynamics/
│       ├── psychological-safety-cases.json
│       └── meeting-anti-patterns.md
├── meta/                     # Cross-cutting knowledge
│   ├── cognitive-biases.json
│   └── ethical-frameworks.md
└── corpus.manifest.json      # Index + schema
```

### 📜 Example: `failure-patterns.json`

```json
{
  "domain": "software-engineering",
  "type": "failure-pattern",
  "entries": [
    {
      "id": "fp-001",
      "name": "Capacity Illusion",
      "description": "Teams overcommit because estimation ignores cognitive load and context switching.",
      "symptoms": [
        "Repeated sprint overruns",
        "High WIP with low throughput",
        "Engineers report 'always context switching'"
      ],
      "root_causes": [
        "Estimation based on ideal hours, not real capacity",
        "No visibility into cognitive tax"
      ],
      "interventions": [
        "Confidence-weighted estimation",
        "WIP limits tied to cognitive load metrics"
      ],
      "related_principles": ["kairos-principle-3", "logos-principle-1"],
      "historical_cases": ["2023-q4-release-delay", "2022-sprint-collapse"]
    }
  ]
}

### ⚙️ How to Integrate with Your Engine

#### 1. **Add a Knowledge Loader**
```js
// knowledge-loader.mjs
import { readdir, readFile } from 'node:fs/promises';
import { resolve } from 'node:path';

export async function loadKnowledge(corpusPath = './knowledge') {
  const knowledge = {};
  const domains = await readdir(resolve(corpusPath));
  
  for (const domain of domains) {
    if (domain === 'corpus.manifest.json') continue;
    knowledge[domain] = {};
    
    const files = await readdir(resolve(corpusPath, domain));
    for (const file of files) {
      const content = await readFile(resolve(corpusPath, domain, file), 'utf8');
      const key = file.replace(/\.(json|md)$/, '');
      knowledge[domain][key] = file.endsWith('.json') ? JSON.parse(content) : content;
    }
  }
  
  return knowledge;
}
```

#### 2. **Inject Knowledge into Personalities**
Modify your engine to pass knowledge to each personality:

```js
// In evolution-engine-v3.mjs
const knowledge = await loadKnowledge();

// When invoking Kairos:
const kairosInsight = await kairos.analyze(problem, {
  knowledge: knowledge['team-dynamics'],
  historicalCases: knowledge['meta']['cognitive-biases']
});
```

#### 3. **Teach Personalities to Use Knowledge**
Example: **Kairos** uses `failure-patterns.json` to reframe problems:

```js
// kairos.mjs
export function analyze(problem, context) {
  const { knowledge } = context;
  
  // Match symptoms to known failure patterns
  const matches = knowledge['failure-patterns'].entries.filter(pattern =>
    pattern.symptoms.some(symptom => 
      problem.toLowerCase().includes(symptom.toLowerCase())
    )
  );
  
  if (matches.length > 0) {
    return {
      reframing: `This matches the "${matches[0].name}" pattern: ${matches[0].description}`,
      leveragePoints: matches[0].interventions,
      knowledgeRef: matches[0].id
    };
  }
  
  // ... fallback to first-principles reasoning
}
```

### 🔍 Advanced: Semantic Indexing (For Large Corpora)

For >100 entries, add **embedding-based retrieval**:

1. **Generate embeddings** for each knowledge entry (using `@xenova/transformers` or an API)
2. **Store in a vector DB** (e.g., simple FAISS index or even JSON with cosine similarity)
3. **Retrieve top-k relevant entries** by embedding similarity

```js
// knowledge-retriever.mjs
export async function retrieveRelevant(problem, knowledge, topK = 3) {
  const problemEmbedding = await embed(problem);
  const scores = [];
  
  for (const entry of knowledge.entries) {
    const sim = cosineSimilarity(problemEmbedding, entry.embedding);
    scores.push({ entry, score: sim });
  }
  
  return scores
    .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)
    .slice(0, topK)
    .map(s => s.entry);
}
```

> 💡 **Start simple**: Use keyword/tag matching first. Add embeddings only when needed.

### 🌐 How This Fits in Your Cognitive Architecture

| Personality | Uses Knowledge To... |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Kairos** | Detect known systemic patterns (avoid reinventing) |
| **Logos** | Generate implementations aligned with proven principles |
| **Mnemos** | Cross-reference new insights with historical cases |
| **Ethos** | Apply ethical frameworks to novel situations |
| **Chronos** | Forecast decay based on historical tech lifecycles |
| **Synthesia** | Decide depth of analysis based on knowledge availability |

> 📌 **Key**: Knowledge is **not a personality** — it’s the **soil** in which personalities grow insights.

### 🚀 Starter Script: `bootstrap-knowledge-corpus.mjs`

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
import { mkdir, writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';
import { resolve } from 'node:path';

const KNOWLEDGE = {
  'domains/team-dynamics/failure-patterns.json': {
    domain: "team-dynamics",
    type: "failure-pattern",
    entries: [
      {
        id: "td-001",
        name: "Unprocessed Release Grief",
        description: "Team morale drops post-release due to unacknowledged compromises.",
        symptoms: ["Blameless postmortems feel hollow", "Engineers disengage after launches"],
        interventions: ["Compromise autopsy ritual", "Pre-release trade-off journaling"]
      }
    ]
  },
  'meta/cognitive-biases.json': {
    entries: [
      {
        name: "Planning Fallacy",
        description: "Underestimating task duration despite past evidence.",
        mitigation: "Use reference class forecasting from historical data."
      }
    ]
  },
  'corpus.manifest.json': {
    version: "1.0.0",
    description: "Organizational knowledge corpus for cognitive engine",
    last_updated: new Date().toISOString()
  }
};

async function main() {
  const base = resolve('./knowledge');
  await mkdir(base, { recursive: true });
  
  for (const [path, content] of Object.entries(KNOWLEDGE)) {
    const fullPath = resolve(base, path);
    await mkdir(resolve(fullPath, '..'), { recursive: true });
    await writeFile(fullPath, JSON.stringify(content, null, 2));
    console.log(`✅ ${path}`);
  }
  
  console.log('\n🧠 Knowledge corpus ready!');
  console.log('   - Extend with your own domain knowledge');
  console.log('   - Reference in personalities via knowledge-loader.mjs');
}

if (import.meta.url === `file://${process.argv[1]}`) {
  main().catch(console.error);
}
```

Run it:
```bash
node bootstrap-knowledge-corpus.mjs
```

### ✅ Summary: Your Path Forward

1. **Create `./knowledge/`** with structured `.json` files  
2. **Build a `knowledge-loader.mjs`** to ingest it  
3. **Pass knowledge to personalities** as contextual input  
4. **Start with keyword/tag matching** — scale to embeddings later  
5. **Treat knowledge as living**: update it after every cognitive cycle

This turns your engine from a **static role-player** into a **continuously learning system** — where personalities don’t just *have* knowledge, they **reason with it**.

Would you like a **template for a domain-specific knowledge schema** (e.g., for security, UX, or DevOps)?
