## üîç Strategic Context: What I Now Understand

### **The Real Goal: Geographic Market Domination**

Your vision is now crystal clear:
- **Current**: 121 suburbs √ó 3 services = 360 pages (limited market)
- **Target**: 345 suburbs √ó 3 services = 1,035 pages (complete dominance)
- **Strategy**: Mathematical adjacency-driven internal linking for "smart" location awareness

**The 121 suburbs aren't the target - they're the stepping stone.**

### **Why the Forensics Hunter is Critical**

Before expanding to 345 suburbs, we need to understand:
1. **Where the 121 suburbs are referenced** (pages, components, data files)
2. **How they're linked together** (navigation, buttons, cross-references)
3. **What components depend on them** (FAQ systems, selectors, generators)
4. **What would break during migration** (hardcoded arrays, switch statements)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Forensics Hunter: Technical Implementation

### **Hunter Architecture Learned from Existing Hunters**

Studying your security.sh, workspace_health.sh, and build_dependencies.sh revealed consistent patterns:

**1. Error Handling Pattern**:
```bash
set -euo pipefail  # Strict mode
REPORT_COMPLETED=0
trap 'if [[ ! -s "$REPORT" || "$REPORT_COMPLETED" != 1 ]]; then create_error_report; fi' EXIT
```

**2. Progressive Scanning**:
```bash
set +e  # Allow commands to fail during detection
# Run analysis commands
set -e  # Re-enable strict mode for report generation
```

**3. JSON Report Structure**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "timestamp",
  "module": "module_name", 
  "status": "pass|warn|critical",
  "critical_issues": 0,
  "warning_issues": 0,
  "findings": { /* specific data */ },
  "policy_invariants": [ /* validation rules */ ],
  "upstream_analysis": { "box": "", "closet": "", "policy": "" }
}
```

### **Forensics Hunter Implementation**

**Created**: `/workspaces/July22/hunters/suburb_forensics.sh`

**Capabilities**:
- ‚úÖ **Direct Reference Scanning**: Uses `rg` to find all mentions of each suburb
- ‚úÖ **Data Source Cross-Check**: Validates presence in registry, coverage, adjacency
- ‚úÖ **Component Usage Analysis**: Tracks imports, getStaticPaths, component coupling
- ‚úÖ **Link and Button Mapping**: Finds href, navigation, onclick patterns
- ‚úÖ **Critical Dependency Detection**: Locates hardcoded arrays, switch statements
- ‚úÖ **Migration Readiness Assessment**: Calculates blockers and complexity scores

**Initial Results** (partial run):
```
Found 70-120 references per suburb
Identified 1 hardcoded array (migration blocker)
Located cross-service linking patterns
Discovered FAQ component dependencies
```

## üß† Key Insights from Hunter Analysis

### **1. Reference Density: High Integration**

Each suburb has **70-120 total references** across the codebase:
- **Direct references**: 30-50 (explicit suburb name usage)
- **Slug patterns**: 1-3 (URL slug generation)
- **URL patterns**: 30-50 (link generation, hrefs)

**Insight**: The 121 suburbs are deeply integrated throughout the system.

### **2. Critical Dependencies Found**

**Hardcoded Arrays**: ‚úÖ **1 detected**
- These are arrays with fixed suburb lists that would break if not updated during migration
- **Risk**: High - would cause build failures or broken functionality

**Switch Statements**: Analyzed but specific count needs refinement
**Conditional Logic**: Pattern exists but needs better detection

### **3. Component Coupling Patterns**

**FAQ Systems**: 14 usage patterns detected
- Suburb-specific FAQ generation
- Context-based FAQ filtering

**Navigation Components**: 4 patterns detected
- Suburb-based navigation menus
- Breadcrumb generation

**Selectors/Dropdowns**: 9 patterns detected
- Suburb selection interfaces
- Filter components

### **4. Data Source Relationships**

**Registry Integration**: All scanned suburbs present in `suburbs.registry.json`
**Service Coverage**: All scanned suburbs in `serviceCoverage.json`  
**Adjacency Graph**: All scanned suburbs in `adjacency.json`

**Insight**: The 121 suburbs are consistently represented across all data sources (good data integrity).

## üéØ Migration Strategy Implications

### **What the Forensics Reveals**

**1. High Integration = Complex Migration**
- 70-120 references per suburb means migration touches most of the codebase
- Can't simply "replace 121 with 345" - need systematic approach

**2. Component Dependencies = Coordinated Updates**
- FAQ, navigation, and selector components all suburb-aware
- Need to update component interfaces to handle 345 suburbs

**3. Hardcoded Dependencies = Migration Blockers**
- 1 hardcoded array found (likely more exist)
- Must identify and update ALL hardcoded suburb lists before migration

**4. Cross-Service Linking = Template Updates**
- Current pages link between services within same suburb
- Need to scale this pattern to 345 suburbs √ó 3 services = 1,035 pages

### **Recommended Migration Approach**

**Phase 1: Complete Forensics** (Fix hunter, run full analysis)
1. Fix jq parameter passing issues in hunter
2. Run complete 121-suburb analysis
3. Generate comprehensive dependency map
4. Identify ALL hardcoded arrays and switch statements

**Phase 2: Dependency Cleanup** (Prepare for migration)
1. Replace hardcoded suburb arrays with dynamic data loading
2. Update component interfaces to be data-driven
3. Implement suburb list providers that can switch between 121/345

**Phase 3: Staged Migration** (121‚Üí345 transition)
1. Generate new `serviceCoverage.json` with all 345 suburbs
2. Update page generation to use adjacency.json as source of truth
3. Test build with new configuration
4. Deploy in stages (batch suburb additions)

**Phase 4: Cross-Service Linking** (Your intelligent navigation vision)
1. Implement within-suburb service cross-linking
2. Add adjacency-based "nearby areas" suggestions
3. Create mathematical relationship-driven navigation

## üîß Technical Refinements Needed

### **Hunter Improvements Required**

**1. Fix jq Parameter Issues**
```bash
# Current (broken):
jq --argjson total_refs "$TOTAL_REFS" 

# Fixed (string handling):
jq --arg total_refs "$TOTAL_REFS" '.total_refs = ($total_refs | tonumber)'
```

**2. Improve Pattern Detection**
- Add file type detection for Astro files
- Enhance hardcoded array detection patterns
- Implement more sophisticated component analysis

**3. Add Cross-Reference Matrix**
- Map which suburbs appear together in same files
- Identify suburb relationship patterns
- Build dependency graph for migration planning

### **Integration with Existing Hunter Ecosystem**

**1. Follow Established Patterns**:
- Use same error handling as security.sh
- Implement same JSON schema as workspace_health.sh
- Add to main hunt.sh execution pipeline

**2. Policy Integration**:
- Add to `geo.linking.config.jsonc` policy framework
- Define invariants for migration readiness
- Integrate with CI/CD quality gates
