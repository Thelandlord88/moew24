## 🚀 Revolutionary Features Analysis

### **🧠 Hunter Thinker - AI Orchestration Engine**

**What it does:**
```javascript
// Multi-factor scoring algorithm
const score = (r) => {
  const sev = r.status === 'critical' ? 2 : r.status === 'warn' ? 1 : 0;
  return (
    weights.severity * sev +
    weights.recurrence * N(r.issues || 0) +
    weights.blastRadius * N(r.affected_files || 0) +
    weights.timeToFix * N(r.eta_minutes || 10) +
    weights.unlocks * ((r.unlocks && r.unlocks.length) || 0)
  );
};
```

**Revolutionary capabilities:**
- ✅ **Priority Intelligence**: Multi-factor scoring (severity, recurrence, blast radius)
- ✅ **Agenda Generation**: Ranked "Do-Next" recommendations with reasoning
- ✅ **Learning System**: Traces patterns and recurrence
- ✅ **Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent handling of hunter contradictions
- ✅ **Hot File Detection**: Identifies frequently problematic files

### **📊 Telemetry System - Learning & Memory**

**Lightweight Event Tracking:**
```bash
# hunters/trace.sh - 10-line telemetry bus
trace_issue() { echo "{\"t\":\"$(date -u +%s)\",\"op\":\"issue\",\"data\":$1}" >> var/hunt-events.ndjson; }
trace_fix() { echo "{\"t\":\"$(date -u +%s)\",\"op\":\"fix\",\"data\":$1}" >> var/hunt-events.ndjson; }
```

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ **Pattern Recognition**: Tracks recurring issues
- ✅ **Performance Learning**: Measures time-to-fix patterns
- ✅ **Impact Analysis**: Correlates fixes with outcomes
- ✅ **Hot Spot Detection**: Identifies problematic files/areas

### **⚙️ Policy-Driven Configuration**

**Tunable Intelligence Without Code Changes:**
```json
{
  "weights": {
    "severity": 3.0,
    "recurrence": 1.6, 
    "blastRadius": 1.4,
    "timeToFix": -0.8,
    "unlocks": 1.2
  },
  "thresholds": { "recommend": 2.0, "critical": 4.0 },
  "caps": { "maxAgendaItems": 8 }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **No Code Edits**: Tune behavior via JSON configuration
- ✅ **Experimentation**: A/B test different prioritization strategies
- ✅ **Team Customization**: Adapt to team preferences and workflows
- ✅ **Dynamic Adjustment**: Change priorities based on project phase

## 🔥 Key Innovations Deep Dive

### **1. Intelligent Agenda Generation**

**Before (Current System):**
```bash
# User sees 6 separate reports:
runtime_ssr: critical (6 issues)
security: warn (3 issues)  
performance: warn (12 issues)
accessibility: warn (8 issues)
code_quality: warn (15 issues)
build_dependencies: warn (2 issues)
# User must manually prioritize
```

**After (Hunters 7.1):**
```json
{
  "agenda": [
    {
      "module": "runtime_ssr",
      "score": 8.4,
      "actions": ["Replace import assertions in geoCompat.runtime.ts"],
      "why": "severity:2 recurrence:6 blast:12 unlocks:3"
    },
    {
      "module": "security", 
      "score": 6.2,
      "actions": ["Remove exposed API keys from .env"],
      "why": "severity:1 blast:25 unlocks:2"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **2. Learning-Based Recurrence Detection**

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Tracks which issues recur frequently
- Identifies root causes vs symptoms
- Learns which fixes are most effective
- Predicts future problem areas

**Hot File Detection:**
```javascript
// Automatically identifies problematic files
const hot = {};
for (const t of traces) {
  if (t.op === "open_file" && t.data?.path) {
    hot[t.data.path] = (hot[t.data.path] || 0) + 1;
  }
}
```

### **3. Fix → Proof → Sibling Sweep Methodology**

**Built-in Workflow:**
1. **Fix**: Apply the recommended change
2. **Proof**: Verify the fix with automated checks
3. **Sibling Sweep**: Find and fix similar issues across codebase

**This is the Upstream-Curious Coach methodology encoded in software!**
