# User Debrief – Repository Health Pack Deployment

## Overview
A consolidated "repo health pack" was applied directly to `main` to strengthen linting, typing, CI guardrails, schema integrity, security posture, and test coverage—without altering runtime site behavior. The goal: elevate maintainability and future change safety while keeping current green build outputs intact.

## What Was Done & Why
1. Replaced ad‑hoc flat ESLint setup with a single conventional `.eslintrc.cjs`.
   - Why: Remove duplicate rule blocks, re‑enable `no-undef` for JS, introduce structured import ordering, unused import pruning, and consistent type import preference. This raises baseline code quality and reduces hidden drift.
2. Added `.eslintignore` for explicit noise filtering (dist artifacts, reports, schema snapshots).
   - Why: Keep lint surface focused; faster lint runs and clearer signal.
3. Added ambient type declarations `src/types/global.d.ts`.
   - Why: Eliminate scattered `@ts-ignore` for JSON imports & env vars; paves path to stronger typing later without friction now.
4. Introduced `scripts/test-schema-hash.mjs` & `schema:hash` script.
   - Why: Locks in single‑emitter JSON‑LD graph shapes; future accidental structural changes surface as diffs (early SEO protection).
5. Added redirect parity Playwright spec `tests/e2e/synonym-redirects.spec.ts`.
   - Why: Ensure every synonym SSR endpoint 301s correctly and preserves query/hash (canonical integrity & analytics continuity).
6. Added minimal unit spec `tests/unit/seoSchema.spec.ts`.
   - Why: Sanity guard for unique `@id` emission; prevents silent duplication regressions before they propagate widely.
7. Implemented `scripts/find-legacy.mjs` & package script `legacy:find`.
   - Why: Fast inventory of legacy/unused or transitional components to support future cleanup sprints.
8. Added `scripts/predev.mjs` + `predev` script.
   - Why: Lightweight non‑fatal validation prior to dev server start (keeps dev loop fast while surfacing data issues early).
9. Hardened package metadata: set `private`, Node engine range, extended lint script coverage, added `lint:fix`, `schema:hash`, `legacy:find`.
   - Why: Prevent accidental publish; codify required Node version; ergonomic maintenance commands.
10. Security & dependency posture: Added CodeQL workflow and Dependabot config.
    - Why: Automate static analysis & dependency update awareness (reduces manual security surface management).
11. Created `.eslintignore` / removed previous flat config file.
    - Why: Align with conventional ESLint config; simpler developer expectation.

## Rationale Integrity (Why This Order)
Changes prioritized foundational hygiene (lint/types) before adding new gates (schema hash, tests) to avoid noisy failures. Security (CodeQL/Dependabot) added after ensuring build remains deterministic so analyzer baselines are stable.

## Files Affected
- `.eslintignore`
- `.eslintrc.cjs`
- `.github/dependabot.yml`
- `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`
- `package.json`
- `scripts/find-legacy.mjs`
- `scripts/predev.mjs`
- `scripts/test-schema-hash.mjs`
- `src/types/global.d.ts`
- `tests/e2e/synonym-redirects.spec.ts`
- `tests/unit/seoSchema.spec.ts`
- (Removed) `eslint.config.js`

## Immediate Impact
- Lint now emits a migration warning (ESLint flat vs legacy). Functional but improvement opportunity (see Improvements).
- Additional tests add marginal CI time but increase confidence in redirects & schema stability.
- Baseline schema hash created on first run; subsequent drifts will flag early.

## Was It a Good Plan?
Strengths:
- High leverage: Mostly additive guardrails with low risk to runtime behavior.
- Clear demarcation of new safety nets (schema hash, redirect parity) that historically catch costly regressions late.
- Ambient types remove tech debt (fewer `@ts-ignore`).
- Security automation added with minimal config surface.

Limitations / Trade‑offs:
- Switching from flat ESLint config to classic `.eslintrc` introduced a warning (could instead have refactored existing flat config to be strict). Not harmful, but noise.
- Lint tightening was only partial (many existing unused vars remain; we warn, not error). Hardening remains a follow‑up.
- Did not unify separate existing workflows (CI, QA, LHCI) into a single matrix to avoid duplicate installs.
- Dependabot without grouping strategy could produce PR noise (limit set to 5 helps, but grouping rules might further reduce churn).

## Recommended Improvements / Next Focus
1. ESLint Migration Cleanup: Either revert to flat config with strict rule set or suppress legacy warning by removing obsolete ignore path expectation (migrate ignores into config root if switching back).
2. Lint Hardening Phase 2: Auto-fix + raise `no-unused-vars` to error after pruning; enable `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` & `no-console` (scripts override allowed).
3. Workflow Consolidation: Merge unit + e2e + schema hash + LHCI into a single reusable build artifact to cut CI minutes.
4. Visual Regression Strategy: Add opt-in snapshot gating (added earlier plan, not yet implemented) so layout shifts are caught alongside schema drift.
5. Expand Ambient Types: Replace `unknown` with concrete interfaces for coverage data & clusters; enables safer refactors.
6. Introduce Perf Budgets in Playwright (trace & metrics) parallel to Lighthouse to catch regressions earlier than scheduled LHCI run.
7. Legacy Cleanup PR: Use `legacy:find` output to delete `.notusing.` files & deprecated `CrossServiceLinks` after monitoring.
8. Schema Hash Scope: Add optional mode to ignore ordering-insensitive additions (e.g., allowlist of nodes) to reduce false positives when intentionally enriching schema.
9. Add README Badge Set: CI, CodeQL, Lighthouse, License for quick project health glance.
10. Bundle Analysis: Integrate `@astrojs/telemetry` or a simple `source-map-explorer` step for JS payload trend detection if client JS grows.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Developers ignore schema hash drift by repeatedly updating baseline. Mitigation: Require PR note referencing intentional SEO change before baseline update commit.
- Risk: CodeQL false positives cause friction. Mitigation: Add a `codeql-config.yml` to exclude generated artifacts if noise appears.
- Risk: Unused warnings accumulate. Mitigation: Time-box a cleanup sprint + enable error level thereafter.

## Summary
The health pack strengthens structural quality (lint/types), safety nets (redirect + schema guard), and security (CodeQL/Dependabot) with minimal disruption. Main improvement area: finalize ESLint approach (flat vs classic) and escalate lint severity once noise is reduced. Next high-value additions: visual diffs + workflow consolidation + lint hardening.
