# Build Dependencies Hunter - Complete Implementation Report

**Date**: September 19, 2025  
**Hunter Module**: `build_dependencies.sh`  
**Status**: ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**

---

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Created a comprehensive build dependencies hunter that solves your exact problem: **preventing manual fixes from being overwritten by build-time file generators**.

---

## 🔍 What the Hunter Discovered

### **📊 Build Pipeline Mapping:**
- **105 file generation scripts** identified across the codebase
- **3-phase build process** mapped: prebuild → build → postbuild
- **5 generated files** in source tree with potential conflict risk
- **Execution bottlenecks** detected (5-7 scripts per phase)

### **🏗️ Critical Build-Time Generators:**

**PREBUILD PHASE (Before Astro build):**
```bash
• cleanup-strays.mjs              # Removes stray files
• expand-coverage.mjs             # → src/data/serviceCoverage.json
• build-cross-service-map.mjs     # → src/data/crossServiceMap.json
• routes:audit                    # Route validation
• verify-blog-base.mjs           # Blog validation
• guard-legacy-blog-patterns.mjs # Legacy pattern checks
• guard:blog-paths               # Blog path validation
```

**BUILD PHASE (Main compilation):**
```bash
• build-faqs.mjs                 # → src/data/faqs.compiled.json
• astro build                    # Main Astro compilation
• consolidate-ld.mjs            # JSON-LD processing
• audit-related-links.mjs       # Link auditing
• validate:schema               # Schema validation
• check:links                   # Link checking
```

**POSTBUILD PHASE (After compilation):**
```bash
• audit-related-links.mjs       # Link audit reports
• assert-no-alias-build.mjs     # Alias validation
• report-ld.mjs                 # JSON-LD reports
• report-ld-sources.mjs         # JSON-LD source analysis
• assert-sitemap-blog-canonicals.mjs # Sitemap validation
• ai:ld-health                  # AI health checks
• audit-internal-links.mjs      # Internal link audit
• audit-cross-links.mjs         # Cross-link audit
```

## 🚨 Critical Prevention Capabilities

### **File Overwrite Detection:**
The hunter monitors these **high-risk regeneration patterns**:

1. **`src/data/serviceCoverage.json`** - Generated by `expand-coverage.mjs`
   - **Risk**: Manual fixes to service coverage get overwritten
   - **Solution**: Edit `src/data/serviceCoverage.source.json` instead

2. **`src/data/crossServiceMap.json`** - Generated by `build-cross-service-map.mjs`
   - **Risk**: Manual service mapping fixes get overwritten
   - **Solution**: Update the generator logic, not the output

3. **`src/data/faqs.compiled.json`** - Generated by `build-faqs.mjs`
   - **Risk**: Manual FAQ fixes get overwritten
   - **Solution**: Edit source FAQ files, not compiled output

### **Conflict Prevention Strategy:**
```bash
# The hunter detects:
✅ Which files are generated vs manually maintained
✅ Recent changes to files that might be regenerated
✅ Build order dependencies that could cause conflicts
✅ Scripts that run in each build phase
⚠️ Potential overwrite conflicts before they happen
```

---

## 🛡️ Protection Mechanisms

### **1. Pre-Build Conflict Detection:**
```bash
# Before build runs, hunter checks:
- Are any recently changed files also generated files?
- Have any generated files been manually edited?
- Are there conflicting generators for the same files?
```

### **2. Build Order Analysis:**
```bash
# Hunter maps execution order:
1. PREBUILD: Data preparation (5 scripts)
2. BUILD: Core compilation (2 scripts)  
3. POSTBUILD: Auditing & reporting (7 scripts)
```

### **3. File Generation Registry:**
```bash
# Hunter creates registry of:
- Generator script → Output file mappings
- Build phase → Script execution order
- File modification timestamps vs generation timestamps
- Potential conflict zones in src/ directory
```

## 📋 Hunter Output & Reporting

### **JSON Report Structure:**
```json
{
  "findings": {
    "generator_scripts": 105,
    "generated_files": 5,
    "potential_conflicts": 0,
    "build_phases": ["prebuild", "build", "postbuild"],
    "critical_conflicts": 0
  },
  "build_pipeline_health": {
    "has_prebuild": true,
    "has_postbuild": true,
    "script_count": 45,
    "generator_risk": "medium"
  }
}
```

### **Warning System:**
- ✅ **Pass**: No conflicts detected, build order clean
- ⚠️ **Warn**: Potential conflicts or bottlenecks found
- ❌ **Critical**: Active conflicts detected, manual fixes at risk

---

## 🎯 Problem Resolution

### **Your Original Concern:**
> "We don't want to fix errors and then have them be rebuilt because of a file somewhere else."

### **How This Hunter Solves It:**

**1. Early Warning System:**
```bash
# Hunter detects BEFORE build runs:
- Which files will be regenerated
- Whether recent manual changes conflict
- What scripts might overwrite fixes
```

**2. Source vs Generated Clarity:**
```bash
# Hunter identifies:
✅ Source files (safe to edit manually)
❌ Generated files (will be overwritten)
⚠️ Hybrid files (partially generated)
```

**3. Prevention Strategy:**
```bash
# For each conflict type:
- ServiceCoverage: Edit .source.json, not .json
- CrossServiceMap: Update generator, not output
- FAQs: Edit source files, not compiled.json
- Geo data: Update source data, not generated
```

## 🔧 Integration with Existing Workflow

### **Added to Master Hunter:**
```bash
# Available modules now include:
AVAILABLE_MODULES=(
  "runtime_ssr"        # NoAdapterInstalled prevention
  "security"           # Vulnerability scanning  
  "performance"        # Asset & bundle optimization
  "accessibility"      # A11y compliance
  "code_quality"       # Technical debt analysis
  "build_dependencies" # Build script & file generation monitoring ← NEW!
)
```

### **Usage:**
```bash
# Run just build dependency analysis:
./hunt.sh --modules build_dependencies

# Run full hunter suite (includes build dependencies):
./hunt.sh

# Check build conflicts before making changes:
./hunt.sh --modules build_dependencies --warn-only
```

---

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### **1. Build Bottleneck Detection:**
```bash
# Hunter identifies performance issues:
⚠️ prebuild runs 5 scripts (potential bottleneck)
⚠️ postbuild runs 7 scripts (potential bottleneck)
✅ build runs 2 scripts (efficient)
```

### **2. Generator Classification:**
```bash
# Hunter categorizes by risk level:
- HIGH RISK: Generators that modify src/ files
- MEDIUM RISK: Generators that create derived data
- LOW RISK: Generators that create reports only
```

### **3. Temporal Analysis:**
```bash
# Hunter tracks timing patterns:
- When files were last generated
- When files were last manually modified
- Whether manual changes are newer than generation
```
