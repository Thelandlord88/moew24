# Oven Cleaning Hacks: Get Your Bond Back

The oven is the #1 reason tenants lose part of their bond. Property managers expect ovens to look nearly new, and a dirty oven can cost you $100-300 in cleaning fees or bond deductions.

## Why Ovens Are Bond Breakers

**Real Estate Agent Perspective:**
- Ovens show tenant care and maintenance habits
- Grease and burnt-on food indicate neglect
- Professional cleaning often costs more than preventive maintenance
- Easy area to justify bond deductions

**Common Problems:**
- Baked-on grease from years of cooking
- Burnt food remnants on oven floor
- Glass door streaks and stains
- Dirty racks and drip trays
- Offensive odors that transfer to food

## Assessment: Can You DIY?

### Light to Moderate Soiling (DIY Suitable)
✅ Surface grease and food splatters
✅ Some staining but no burnt-on carbon
✅ Glass door mostly clear with some spots
✅ Racks have some buildup but aren't black
✅ No strong offensive odors

### Heavy Soiling (Professional Recommended)
❌ Thick, black carbon buildup
❌ Burnt-on food covering oven floor
❌ Glass door opaque with grease
❌ Racks completely blackened
❌ Strong smell even when cold
