# Brisbane Bond Cleaning: Ultimate Guide for Tenants

Moving out of your rental property in Brisbane? Getting your full bond back depends on meeting the strict cleaning standards expected by property managers and landlords.

## What is Bond Cleaning?

Bond cleaning (also called end-of-lease cleaning) is a comprehensive clean required when vacating a rental property. It must restore the property to the same condition as when you moved in, minus normal wear and tear.

## Brisbane Property Standards

Queensland's Residential Tenancies Authority (RTA) sets specific guidelines:

- Property must be "reasonably clean"
- All personal belongings removed
- Gardens maintained (if applicable)
- All damages beyond normal wear repaired

## Essential Cleaning Areas

### Kitchen Deep Clean
- **Oven:** Remove all grease, burnt-on food, and odors
- **Stovetop:** Clean burners, drip trays, and control knobs
- **Refrigerator:** Defrost, clean inside/outside, remove all food
- **Cupboards:** Wipe inside and out, including shelves
- **Sink:** Remove limescale, polish taps

### Bathroom Standards
- **Tiles & Grout:** Remove soap scum, mold, limescale
- **Shower Screen:** Clean to streak-free finish
- **Toilet:** Sanitize inside and out, including behind pedestal
- **Mirrors:** Polish to perfect clarity
- **Exhaust Fan:** Clean cover and housing

### Living Areas
- **Carpets:** Professional steam cleaning often required
- **Windows:** Clean inside and out, including frames
- **Light Fixtures:** Dust and wipe all fittings
- **Skirting Boards:** Remove dust and marks
- **Walls:** Spot clean marks and scuffs

## Brisbane Specific Considerations

### Climate Factors
- **Humidity:** Extra attention to mold prevention
- **Dust:** Regular dusting in Brisbane's dry periods
- **Outdoor Areas:** Balconies and patios need thorough cleaning

### Property Types
- **Queenslanders:** High ceilings require professional cleaning
- **Apartments:** Balcony cleaning standards are strict
- **Houses:** Pool and garden maintenance requirements

## Cost Expectations (Brisbane 2025)

| Property Type | Bond Clean Cost |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 1-bed apartment | $300-450 |
| 2-bed unit | $400-600 |
| 3-bed house | $550-800 |
| 4+ bed house | $700-1200 |

*Prices include GST and basic carpet cleaning*

## Professional vs DIY

### When to Hire Professionals
- Limited time (less than 2 days)
- Lack of proper equipment
- Carpet cleaning required
- Oven in poor condition
- Want guarantee of bond return

### DIY Approach
- Budget-conscious tenants
- Property in good condition
