# Carpet Cleaning for Bond Return: Steam vs Professional

Carpet cleaning is often the make-or-break factor in getting your full bond back. Property managers scrutinize carpets more than almost any other area, and the wrong approach can cost you hundreds of dollars.

## Why Carpet Cleaning Matters for Bond Return

**Real Estate Agent Expectations:**
- Carpets must look and smell fresh
- Stains must be completely removed
- High-traffic areas restored to original condition

### 2. Professional Hot Water Extraction

### Choose Professional When:
- Carpets over 5 years old or heavily used

## Bond Return Guarantee

4. **Get quotes:** Professional cleaning may be closer in price than expected
