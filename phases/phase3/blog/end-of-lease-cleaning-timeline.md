### Photography Schedule:
- **Before:** Comprehensive photos before starting (Day 1)

### Receipt Organization:
- Keep all cleaning supply receipts

## Regional Timing Considerations

### Brisbane Properties:
- Allow extra drying time during humid periods
- Book professional services 2-3 weeks in advance
- Consider weather delays for outdoor cleaning

### Logan/Ipswich Properties:
- Professional services may need longer lead times
- Factor in travel time if using Brisbane-based services
- Seasonal considerations for garden maintenance requirements
